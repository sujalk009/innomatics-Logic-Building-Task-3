# Data Science Internship - Python Programming Assignment

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains my solutions to the **Data Processing and Analysis Task** for the Data Science Internship at Innomatics Technology Hub (February 2026). The assignment focuses on applying Python programming concepts to solve real-world data analysis problems.

## 🎯 Assignment Objectives
- Apply Python data structures (dictionaries, lists, strings, tuples)
- Perform data validation and processing
- Analyze patterns in datasets
- Write clean, well-documented code

- Statistical calculation (percentages)
- Data aggregation

**Input:** List of employee email addresses  
**Output:** Domain usage percentages

---

### Problem 5: Sales Spike Detection
**Objective:** Detect unusual sales activity by identifying spikes above average.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
- Statistical analysis (average calculation)
- Threshold-based filtering
- Anomaly detection

**Input:** Daily sales figures  
**Output:** Days with sales 30% above average

---

### Problem 6: Duplicate User ID Detection
**Objective:** Identify data integrity issues by finding duplicate user registrations.

**Skills Demonstrated:**
